This study presents a comprehensive computational framework for developing a high-performance Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model for 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-based LSD1 inhibitors. The framework integrates a consensus feature selection strategy, a novel triple-kernel Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, and a hybrid Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO)-Bayesian algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. The resulting model was then applied to guide the rational design of novel potent inhibitor candidates.
